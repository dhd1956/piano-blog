Dave Davies is an IT Professional who has been playing the piano forever. He currently works remote and has the pleasure of playing piano at home whenever he wants. He generally plays by ear although he took lessons 'back in the day' and can read music but currently not sight-read it.

Wanting to develop his technique and dynamics (instead of just loud...), he is now recording his playing on his phone each time he plays. Being excited about Blockchain technology, he has this blog to track his progress and publish on a Blockchain whenever he decides that a recording is worth publishing.

Although the recordings are basic, the naming convention of the recordings indicate the songs or highlights being followed.

Publishing, searching and retrieving recordings is a future step to this blog.
