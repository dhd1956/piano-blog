# Introduction

I played last night. The sustain pedal squeaks. I step on it quite a bit when I play. While I find it annoying, It gets me to play more without the sustain. I had the same effect
at the cottage on the electric piano. The pedal there needs to be anchored somehow and moves around when I step on it, so I tend to play with less sustain as a result.

I didn't play long last night. I still find it difficult to breath while playing. I keep wanting to work on it but have spent very little time trying to breath long and smooth while playing.
