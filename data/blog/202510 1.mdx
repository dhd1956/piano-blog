# Introduction

I listen to these lovely piano songs. There's Oscar, Ahmad Jamal, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett and a million excellent pianists that I hear in my Livingroom. I have tried to come up with the lush chords that I hear. I want to expand my selection to include this.

Back to basics. I opened up my piano bench yesterday. It is filled to the brim with music books. I am so slow and clumsy at reading music. I decided that if I am professing to developing my piano style, I can go back to basics. I pulled out the Royal Conservatory Of Music, book 4. Now this takes discipline. I was told by Paul de Marky that I don't have discipline. But that was more than 50 years ago. The last time I tried playing by music it was from my paternal grand-father and namesake who wrote hymns and got them published to be played and sang in church. I struggled with playing his music a couple of years ago. I was amazed how slow and impatient I was reading music. I used to play saxaphone in the high school band. But that is a single note at a time.

So the music book is now on the piano. I will find and report my effort and practise this week.
