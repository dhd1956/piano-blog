# Introduction
---

It's been a while since I played on a different piano. I have been playing for my wife and dog
in the livingroom. I have a banker's lamp with a red bulb in it that sits on top of the piano.
I turn off all the other lights and stage a 'Red Light Concert' to the delight of my audience.

I also have a Yamaha electric piano that resides at my daughter's cottage. I am at the cottage now.
I don't like playing it near as much as the acoustic piano at home. There's a full drum set as well
here and the snare rattles when I play.
