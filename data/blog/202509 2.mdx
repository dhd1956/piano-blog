Here I am on a Sunday morning wondering about how my piano style is going? I haven't been playing as often. I like to play around 10pm and I don't play after 11pm as the neighbours can hear me. Sometimes I play during the day when lunch is being prepared. I'm thinking that I would like to get more serious now rather than wait for the website to be in production.

I have a list of songs that I like to play. The list has grown a bit as I dometimes remember and write down the name of a a song that I used to play. I haven't come up with an original song for a few years. I have had a couple of starts but no finished song to add to my list. Maybe this will change.

My wife and I walked down Main St. in Newmarket last night. There indeed is life on the street. The 'Made In Mexico' restaurant had a line up and a 30 minute wait. Other than that, it there were a few places with music. Finding a place with an acoustic piano was not likely. Perhaps a Sunday afternoon stroll would be more useful for this.

While I am building the software around this app, I could be developing my piano style in other ways. I've never been excited about scales and arpaggeous. I've never focused much on that. I took lessons when I was a young teenager and that really cataliyzed my style back then. Maybe I will start scales now. Teach an old dog new tricks.

Since I record on my phone when I play at home, I can find time to play it back and see if that can be more of a catalyst for developing my style. Like writing this blog, I can slow down and replay parts. I haven't done much of that either. I can start doing that as well.

So I went out to get groceries by myself in the car. I put on my last 3 recordings and noticed how loud I play. Playing loud is maybe a good workout, but it is a bit of a pain to listen to. Instead of being annoyed at the squeek of the pedal, it let's me know when and how often I use the sustain pedal. That is sort of instructive.
