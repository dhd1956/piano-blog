# Introduction

I started using a new Android music recorder: 'Dolby On'. It wasn't a fair comparison since
I am at the cottage with my Yamaha electric piano in the upstairs with a snare drum rattling
as I play and an old amplifier with a fuzzy sound.

Since the sustain pedal is hard to control, I landed up playing without it. I came up with
something that I consider to be the makings of a new song. So I am happy with that.

Apparently with Audacity I can shrink the size of my audio files...
