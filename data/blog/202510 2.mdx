# Introduction

I put in a good 10 minutes on the first song. I have new plants in my livingroom. One of them was hanging over the keyboard. I shuffled them around and now I have room once again at the keyboard.

I shall spend more time today. Yes, that's my piano. It belonged to my mother. It is a Heinzman. It was built in Toronto and moved to the foothills of the Rockies west of Edmonton where my mother was born and raised.
