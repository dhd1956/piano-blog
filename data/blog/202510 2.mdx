# Introduction

I put in a good 10 minutes on the first song.

I have new plants in my livingroom. One of them was hanging over the keyboard. I shuffled them around and now I have room once again.

shall spend more time today. Yes, that's my piano. It belonged to my mother. It is a Heinzman. It
was built in Toronto and moved to the foothills of the Rockies west of Edmonton where my mother was
born and raised.

Here it is Sunday afternoon. I allocated 10 minutes to donate to my studies of the Royal Conservatory. I did it! I got about 12 bars into it with the fingering pattern. Slow but steady progress. I know that my fingering is somewhat limited and stylized and am predicting that following this sheet music is an excellent longer term way of breaking 50 years of habit in my hands. I'm glad I time boxed it. Maybe it's my IT experience but I like to time my activities. Besides music is totally a time experience. I meditate using my phone's timer. I'm up to 20 minutes per day. I'm ready to put in more time on this. I actually enjoy using other parts of my brain while playing piano. It keeps me from drifting off in my thinking as tend to do when playing by ear.
